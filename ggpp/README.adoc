= Google C++ Utilities

C++ STL is still not enough to cover daily development. Google has some great utility codes in their projects located under the `base` or `utils` folder.

This project don't port well-known libraries features:

. Abseil
. GLOG

== Workflow

We use copybara as the workflow engine to port source codes from different repositories into our repository.

Please modify the `../copy.bara.sky` file for porting new files.

== Google projects

We would prefer to collect codes from Google's well-known open-source projects:

. Chromium
. LevelDB
. TensorFlow
. OR-Tools
